## Getting OAuth keys

Create a new Application for TweetWall within https://apps.twitter.com[Twitter Apps site] signing in
with the twitter account that will be used to run the TweetWallFX. You have to enter at least the
website of your company. After doing so generate a new access token under `Keys and Access Tokens`.

Update the `tweetwallConfig.json` file with your OAuth values as follows:
